### 01: Bootstrap 4: Review and Upgrade -  2.25 hrs
- Treehouse - Bootstrap 4:  This module will help us review bootstrap basics, learn the newest version of bootstrap, and teach us how to follow a mockup.

- **Outcomes**: Ability to implement a mockup using basic bootstrap styles.

### 02: CSS Fundamentals - 7 hrs
- Treehouse - CSS Basics: This module will go over all of the core concepts and 'gotchas' in CSS. There is very little coding. Its important to focus on understanding the core concepts, seeing where css was and where it is going. As well as setting the context for how solutions like preprocessors and flexbox help companies maintain a competitive advantage.

- **Outcomes**: Ability to reason about css behavior and solve css related problems.

### 03: Converting From CSS to Sass - 1.25 hrs
- Treehouse - CSS to Sass:  This is our first dive into fundamentals of programming. Sass is a very simple (yet elegant) programming language. This module will introduce variables, if-statements, and loops. We will demonstrate how Sass helps keep our css DRY.  Most importantly, we will gain the in-demand skill of converting a plain CSS codebase to a more robust one that uses Sass.

- **Outcomes**: Familiarization with fundamentals of programming. Understand the  importance of DRY code. Ability to convert plain CSS codebase to one that uses a preprocessor.

### 04: Customizing Bootstrap with `Less` - 1.5hrs
- Lynda- Customizing Bootstrap with `Less`: Less is another common preprocessor. Less usage seems to be on the decline, however there are many codebases that still rely on it.  The goal of this module is to compare preprocessors and move past basic bootstrap styling. Organizations want designs that incorporate there logo, colors, and typography. Customizing a basic bootstrap layout will help achieve this goal.   

- **Outcomes**: Customize a CSS framework to match organizational branding with the aid of a preprocessor.


### 05: Flexbox Fundamentals and Layout - 1.25 hrs
- Treehouse: Flexbox Layouts :Consensus is gaining that flexbox is the way forward with CSS. It is simple yet powerful abstraction for designing responsive UIs. However, the most appealing element of flexbox is it also lends itself perfectly to mobile development. Which means, one abstraction for all platforms.   
- Introduce Flexbox Froggy

- **Outcomes**: Ability to build a responsive layout using flexbox. Prepare for future courses on mobile layout.

### 06: Initializing and Developing your Portfolio
- We will be given two design packages (fonts, color schemes, and assets, mockups). From these two packages well will implement two websites that promote fictitious businesses.  We should choose different css tools (sass, less, or flexbox) for each project to show our knowledge. The first versions of each will be deployed using github pages and initiate our portfolios.

- **Outcomes**: Ability to deploy a project that is linked to the codebase. This gives employers a  coherent way to analyze the applicants portfolio.

### Extra Iteration:  More Bootstrap and CSS
- Lynda- Designing a Responsive Site with Bootstrap: Depending on progress, we can hold an extra session to reinforce bootstrap and css concepts. This will also serve as a gentle introduction to Javascript and jQuery.
